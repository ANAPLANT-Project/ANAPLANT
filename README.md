# ANAPLANT
Project for updating the target ranges for plant analysis

## Introduction
The plant analysis, which has been mainly developed between 1960 - 1990, compares nutrient concentrations in the crops with target ranges/critical values at an early vegetation stage. Following, nutrient deficits can be balanced by late soil or foliar fertilization. Due to changed framework conditions - e.g. climate change, reduction of emissions, new varieties, the EIP-Agri financed project aimed to set up standardized protocols for data collection, an expandable datasheet and evaluation tools to start with the update/validation of target ranges. A total of 1.212 data sets was sampled on field and trial sites in three growing seasons (2022-2024) from the arable crops oilseed rape, barley, rye, wheat, maize, sugar beet, potatoes and grain peas. We compared the literature values with target ranges
calculated from mean nutrient concentrations of high yielding subsets and deduced from a boundary line around scatter plots of the relation nutrient concentration/yield and the CV as maximum. Results after three years are published under https://www.anaplant.de/. 

## Goal
This GitHub project is meant to enlarge the dataset and to collaborate on result analysis.
